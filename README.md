## Project description

Selenium project

Pegasus Airline web page testing with Selenium project. Created with JavaScript's superset Typescript. The project has 15 regression tests, which are tests done for individual web page functionalities. One smoke test, which is the main functionality of the web page tested from beginning to end. More specifically, the program shows the process of buying a flight ticket step by step. Even though the project is fully done, and all functions are written, the web page had unfortunately crashed and access has been restricted so the final, smoke test, could not be executed until the end.
